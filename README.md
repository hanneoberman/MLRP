This repository serves as working directory for the course 'Markup Languages and Reproducible Programming' (Utrecht University). It contains the following folders:

- `Simulation_study` | Small simulation study to show proficiency with Markdown.

- `Shiny_app` | Elementary Shiny app to explore functionalities and lay foundation for `ShinyMICE` thesis project.

And a file explaining where to find which documents for grading the coursework (`Dear_Gerko.Rmd`).


Note. *This repository is only a showcase for educational purposes. The Shiny app is **not** a finished product.*
